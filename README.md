The website: https://ingaleomkar.github.io/BMICalculator/

This project was developed to help people calculate their BMI (Body mass index).

To do so, the users need to input two values:
- Their Weight (in Kilograms)
- Their Height (in centimeters) 

[The value of height is converted to meters for further calculation] 

The formula to calculate BMI is = weight/ (height * height)

Several catergories are listed for the users to compare their BMIs.
